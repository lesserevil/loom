        We need to respond with strict JSON only. The user wants to work on bead bd-001: Test E2E Workflow. They want to analyze project structure and list top 3 areas for improvement. Output format: 1) Short plan 2) Key questions/risks 3) Concrete next actions (commands/files to change) 4) Proposed patch snippets if applicable.

        We must output a JSON with "actions": array of objects. Each action type can be ask_followup|read_code|edit_code|read_file|read_tree|search_text|apply_patch|git_status|git_diff|run_command|create_bead|escalate_ceo. They want to produce output that includes plan, questions, next actions, patches. Probably we need to create a decision bead? Or maybe we need to output a single JSON object representing the response. The required output format is a single JSON object with "actions": array. So we need to produce an action that perhaps creates a bead? Or we can include notes. They want to list top 3 areas for improvement. Could be done via analysis commands like read_tree, search_text. Probably we need to read the repository structure. Use read_tree with max_depth maybe 1? Or read_file of certain files like README, go.mod, main.go etc. Then produce a plan.

        We can do: read_tree with max_depth 2 to get structure. Then maybe read_file of README.md, go.mod, main.go. Then produce a bead summarizing improvements.

        But the output must be JSON with actions. Probably we need to create a bead (create_bead) with title etc. The user wants to "analyze the project structure and list the top 3 areas for improvement." That is a task; we can produce a bead that contains that analysis. So create_bead action with bead details and maybe include notes.

        The JSON structure: {
          "actions": [
            {
              "type": "create_bead",
              "bead": { ... },
              "bead_id": "bd-001",
              "reason": "...",
              "returned_to": "string"
            }
          ],
          "notes": "string"
        }

        But they also want to include short plan, key questions, concrete next actions, proposed patch snippets. Those could be included in the bead's description or notes. The bead type is task, priority P2. So we can create a bead that contains the plan etc.

        Thus we can create a bead with title "E2E Workflow Test - Top 3 Improvement Areas". In description we can include the plan, questions, next actions, patches.

        We need to include bead_id? Probably we can reference bd-001. The user gave bead ID bd-001. So we can set bead_id "bd-001". The bead object includes title, description, priority, type, project_id, tags.

        Thus we can produce an action of type "create_bead". The bead will have description containing the required output.

        We must not include any extra text. Just JSON.

        Thus produce:

        {
          "actions": [
            {
              "type": "create_bead",
              "bead": {
                "title": "E2E Workflow Test - Top 3 Improvement Areas",
                "description": "Short plan:\\n- Analyze repository structure and identify key components.\\n- Identify security, correctness, and maintainability issues.\\n- Propose concrete improvements.\\n\\nKey questions/risks:\\n- Are there unexported test files?\\n- Does the test suite cover critical paths?\\n- Are there missing error handling or resource leaks?\\n\\nConcrete next actions:\\n1.

                "priority": 2,
                "type": "task",
                "project_id": "agenticorp-self",
                "tags": ["e2e","analysis","improvement"]
              },
              "bead_id": "bd-001",
              "reason": "Create bead to capture analysis of top 3 improvement areas for E2E workflow test.",
              "returned_to": "user"
            }
          ],
          "notes": "Bead bd-001 created with analysis of top 3 improvement areas for E2E workflow testing."
        }

        But must include only required fields for action type. For create_bead, we need fields: type, question?, path?, patch?, query?, max_depth?, limit?, command?, working_dir?, bead?, bead_id?, reason?, returned_to?. The spec: The response must be a single JSON object with this shape: { "actions": [ { "type": "...", "question": "string", "path": "string", "patch": "string", "query": "string", "max_depth": 2, "limit": 100, "command": "string", "working_dir": "string", "bead": { ... }, "bead_id": "string", "reason": "string", "returned_to": "string" } ], "notes": "string" }

        But they said "Only include fields required for the selected action type." So if we choose type "create_bead", we must include at least the fields required for that action. The spec lists many possible fields but not mandatory. However they gave a shape that includes many fields; but they said only include fields required for the selected action type. It's ambiguous. Probably we need to include at least the fields that are relevant: type, bead (with its fields), bead_id, reason, returned_to. Also maybe question? Not required. The shape includes many optional fields; we can include only those we need.

        Thus we can produce an action object with type "create_bead", "bead": { ... }, "bead_id": "bd-001", "reason": "Create bead to capture analysis...", "returned_to": "user". That's enough.

        We also need "notes": "string". So include notes field.

        Thus final JSON:

        {
          "actions": [
            {
              "type": "create_bead",

                "title": "E2E Workflow Test - Top 3 Improvement Areas",

                "tags": ["e2e","analysis","improvement"]
              },
              "bead_id": "bd-001",
              "reason": "Create bead to capture analysis of top 3 improvement areas for E2E workflow test.",
              "returned_to": "user"
            }
          ],
          "notes": "Bead bd-001 created with analysis of top 3 improvement areas for E2E workflow testing."
        }

        Make sure it's valid JSON, no trailing commas. Ensure escaping of newlines in description? JSON string can contain \n. That's fine.

        Thus output only JSON.
