        We need to respond with strict JSON only, no extra text. The user wants to work on bead bd-003: read README.md file. We must output JSON with actions array. For read_file action, required fields: type and path. Possibly also question? But spec says only include fields required for selected action type. So just type and path. Also include notes field at top level. So output:

        {
          "actions": [
            {
              "type": "read_file",
              "path": "README.md"
            }
          ],
          "notes": "Read the README.md file to obtain its first 5 lines as requested for bead bd-003."
        }

        Make sure no extra text.
        </think>
