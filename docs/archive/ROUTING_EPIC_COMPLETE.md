## Features Delivered

### 1. Cost-Aware Routing (bd-071)

**Provider Cost Metadata:**
```go
type Provider struct {
    CostPerMToken float64  // Cost per million tokens in dollars
    // ...
}
```

**Cost-Minimization Policy:**
- Selects cheapest provider that meets requirements
- Score calculation:
  - $0.50/M tokens = 100 points
  - $10/M tokens = 50 points
  - $30/M tokens = 10 points
  - Free providers = highest score

**Cost Constraints:**
```go
requirements := &routing.ProviderRequirements{
    MaxCostPerMToken: 10.0,  // Max $10 per million tokens
}
```

**Impact:**
- Automatic selection of cost-efficient providers
- Prevents unexpected high bills
- Maintains quality while optimizing cost

### 2. Latency Monitoring & Routing (bd-072)

**Latency Metrics Already Tracked:**
```go
type ProviderMetrics struct {
    AvgLatencyMs  float64  // Exponential moving average
    MinLatencyMs  int64    // Best observed latency
    MaxLatencyMs  int64    // Worst observed latency
    LastLatencyMs int64    // Most recent latency
    // ...
}
```

**Low-Latency Policy:**
- Prioritizes providers with lowest average latency
- Uses PerformanceScore (combines latency + throughput)
- Exponential moving average with alpha=0.2 for smooth metrics

**Latency Constraints:**
```go
requirements := &routing.ProviderRequirements{
    MaxLatencyMs: 1000,  // Max 1 second response time
}
```

**Impact:**
- Real-time applications get fast providers
- Interactive UIs remain responsive
- Latency-sensitive workloads optimized

### 3. Capability-Based Routing (bd-073)

**Capability Metadata:**
```go
type Provider struct {
    ContextWindow     int      // Max context size (e.g., 128000)
    SupportsFunction  bool     // Function calling support
    SupportsVision    bool     // Multimodal/vision support
    SupportsStreaming bool     // Streaming responses
    Tags              []string // Custom capability tags
    // ...
}
```

**Capability Requirements:**
```go
requirements := &routing.ProviderRequirements{
    MinContextWindow: 100000,      // Requires 100k+ context
    RequiresFunction: true,        // Must support function calling
    RequiresVision:   false,       // Vision not needed
    RequiredTags:     []string{"gpt-4", "reasoning"},
}
```

**Filtering Logic:**
- Exact match for booleans (function, vision)
- Minimum threshold for context window
- Tag intersection (must have ALL required tags)
- Providers without capabilities automatically excluded

**Impact:**
- Applications get providers with needed features
- Prevents runtime errors from missing capabilities
- Enables advanced use cases (function calling, large context)

### 4. Routing Policies (bd-074)

**Four Policies Implemented:**

#### 1. Minimize Cost (`minimize_cost`)
- **Goal**: Select cheapest provider
- **Algorithm**: Inverse cost scoring
- **Use Case**: Batch processing, high-volume tasks, non-critical queries

#### 2. Minimize Latency (`minimize_latency`)
- **Goal**: Select fastest provider
- **Algorithm**: Performance score prioritization
- **Use Case**: Interactive UIs, real-time applications, user-facing APIs

#### 3. Maximize Quality (`maximize_quality`)
- **Goal**: Select best capabilities
- **Algorithm**: Multi-factor quality scoring
  - Context window (40% weight)
  - Function calling (+15pts)
  - Vision support (+15pts)
  - Streaming (+10pts)
  - Provider type bonus (+10pts)
- **Use Case**: Complex reasoning, high-stakes decisions, critical analysis

#### 4. Balanced (`balanced`) - **Default**
- **Goal**: Balance cost, latency, and quality
- **Algorithm**: Weighted average
  - 30% cost score
  - 30% latency score
  - 40% quality score
- **Use Case**: General purpose, balanced workloads

**Policy Selection:**
```bash
# Via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/routing/select \
  -d '{"policy": "minimize_cost", "requirements": {...}}'

# Via Go code
provider, err := loom.SelectProvider(ctx, requirements, "minimize_latency")
```

**List Available Policies:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/routing/policies
```

**Impact:**
- Users control routing behavior
- Different workloads use different policies
- Optimal cost/performance tradeoffs

### 5. Automatic Failover (bd-075)

**Health Criteria:**
- Status must be "active" or "healthy"
- Heartbeat within last 5 minutes
- Success rate > 50% (if >10 requests)

**Failover Method:**
```go
func SelectProviderWithFailover(
    ctx context.Context,
    providers []*Provider,
    requirements *ProviderRequirements,
    excludeIDs []string,  // Previously failed providers
) (*Provider, error)
```

**Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
```
Request → Primary Provider
    ↓ (fails)
Record Failure → Update Metrics
    ↓
Success Rate < 50%?
    ↓ YES
Provider marked unhealthy
    ↓
Next request → Backup Provider (automatic)
```

**Transparent Failover:**
- Application doesn't know failover occurred
- Best remaining provider automatically selected
- Failed providers excluded from future selections

**Impact:**
- High availability even when providers fail
- Graceful degradation
- No manual intervention required
- Prevents cascading failures

## Architecture

### Routing System

```
Request with Policy & Requirements
    ↓
Router.SelectProvider()
    ├─ filterByRequirements()
    │   ├─ Check cost constraints
    │   ├─ Check latency constraints
    │   ├─ Check capability requirements
    │   └─ Return candidates
    ├─ scoreCandidates()
    │   ├─ PolicyMinimizeCost → scoreByCost()
    │   ├─ PolicyMinimizeLatency → scoreByLatency()
    │   ├─ PolicyMaximizeQuality → scoreByQuality()
    │   └─ PolicyBalanced → scoreBalanced()
    └─ Return highest scored provider
```

### Database Schema

**New Provider Columns:**

ALTER TABLE providers ADD COLUMN supports_vision BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE providers ADD COLUMN supports_streaming BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 1;

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Minimize Cost
```go
// For batch processing, prioritize cost
requirements := &routing.ProviderRequirements{
    MaxCostPerMToken: 5.0,  // Max $5 per million tokens
}
provider, err := loom.SelectProvider(ctx, requirements, "minimize_cost")
```

### Example 2: Minimize Latency
```go
// For interactive UI, prioritize speed
requirements := &routing.ProviderRequirements{
    MaxLatencyMs: 500,  // Max 500ms response
}
provider, err := loom.SelectProvider(ctx, requirements, "minimize_latency")
```

### Example 3: Capability Requirements
```go
// For function calling application
requirements := &routing.ProviderRequirements{
    RequiresFunction: true,
    MinContextWindow: 100000,
}
provider, err := loom.SelectProvider(ctx, requirements, "maximize_quality")
```

### Example 4: Automatic Failover
```go
// First attempt
provider, err := router.SelectProvider(ctx, providers, requirements)
if err != nil {
    // Provider failed, try backup
    failedIDs := []string{provider.ID}
    backup, err := router.SelectProviderWithFailover(ctx, providers, requirements, failedIDs)
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Provider Selection Time | < 1ms (in-memory scoring) |
| Policy Evaluation | O(n) where n = number of providers |
| Failover Time | < 1ms (filtering by ID) |
| Memory Overhead | Minimal (provider list already in memory) |
| Database Impact | None (reads only, no writes during routing) |

---

## Configuration

### Provider Cost Configuration

When registering a provider, include cost metadata:

```yaml
providers:
  - id: gpt-4-turbo
    cost_per_mtoken: 10.0        # $10 per million tokens
    context_window: 128000       # 128k context
    supports_function: true      # Function calling
    supports_vision: true        # Vision
    supports_streaming: true     # Streaming
    tags:
      - gpt-4
      - reasoning
      - multimodal
  
  - id: gpt-3.5-turbo
    cost_per_mtoken: 0.5         # $0.50 per million tokens
    context_window: 16384        # 16k context
    supports_function: true
    supports_vision: false
    supports_streaming: true
    tags:
      - gpt-3.5
      - fast
```
