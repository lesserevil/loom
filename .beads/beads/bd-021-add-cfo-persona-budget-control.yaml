title: P0 - Add CFO persona for provider cost monitoring and budget control
description: |
  Create a CFO persona responsible for monitoring provider costs, securing a
  monthly budget from the CEO, and recommending cost-control measures when
  spend is trending high.

  Responsibilities
  - Track provider spend and forecast monthly burn.
  - Request/confirm a monthly budget with the CEO.
  - If spend is trending toward early budget exhaustion:
    - Recommend cost controls to Arbiter:
      - prefer on-prem providers
      - throttle work rate
      - apply other cost-saving controls
  - If staying within budget is not possible:
    - Ask CEO to decide: increase budget OR temporarily pause all work.
    - Convey the CEO decision to Arbiter and to the CFO persona.

  Implementation Notes
  - Add persona files: personas/examples/cfo/{PERSONA.md,AI_START_HERE.md}
  - Define CFO coordination workflow with CEO (decision beads or explicit policy)
  - Ensure CFO guidance can be surfaced to Arbiter policies for routing/throttling

  Acceptance Criteria
  - CFO persona exists and is discoverable via personas listing.
  - CFO behavior includes cost monitoring, budget requests, and cost controls.
  - CFO can trigger a CEO decision when budget cannot be met.
  - CFO communicates approved decision back to Arbiter.
