description: |
    Enable effective team collaboration on agent-driven projects with shared workspaces
    and real-time updates.

    Problem: AgentiCorp is currently single-user focused, limiting team collaboration.

    Goals:
    - Shared workspaces
    - Real-time collaboration on beads
    - Agent work visibility across team
    - Commenting and discussion threads
    - Team usage analytics

    Sub-features to implement:
    - Multi-user workspace support
    - Shared bead board with real-time updates
    - Team member permissions
    - Activity feed and notifications
    - Team cost tracking and budgets

    Success Criteria: Teams can effectively collaborate on agent-driven projects.

    User Impact: Enables team workflows and coordination.
