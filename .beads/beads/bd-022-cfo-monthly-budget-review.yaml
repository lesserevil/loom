title: P1 - CFO monthly budget review and long-term budget decisions
description: |
  Extend the CFO persona to perform monthly budget reviews and avoid assuming
  that all budget increases are permanent.

  Responsibilities
  - Perform a monthly budgetary review:
    - compare actual spend vs forecast
    - identify over/under budget trends
  - If consistently over budget:
    - ask CEO to decide on a lasting budget increase OR accept slower work to
      stay within the previous budget.
  - If consistently under budget:
    - explicitly acknowledge/celebrate this outcome in CFO reporting.

  Implementation Notes
  - Update CFO persona docs (PERSONA.md + AI_START_HERE.md).
  - Add guidance for when to trigger the “lasting decision” vs short-term
    budget adjustments.

  Acceptance Criteria
  - CFO persona includes monthly budget review responsibilities.
  - CFO asks for long-term decisions when overruns persist.
  - CFO acknowledges sustained under-budget operation.
