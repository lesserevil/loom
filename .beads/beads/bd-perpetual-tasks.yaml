title: "Implement perpetual tasks for org chart roles"
description: |
  Implement automated perpetual task system for key org chart roles:
  
  Goals:
  - CFO: Monthly budget reviews and financial reporting
  - PR Manager: Poll GitHub for new issues/PRs  
  - Documentation Manager: Automated documentation updates
  - QA Engineer: Run automated test suites
  
  These tasks should be created as beads by the dispatcher when agents are in idle mode,
  enabling proactive agent workflows rather than purely reactive ones.
  
  Implementation Areas:
  - Dispatcher logic to recognize idle agents with perpetual roles
  - Task templates for each role type
  - Scheduling system (daily, weekly, monthly triggers)
  - Integration with motivation system
  
  Success Criteria:
  - Agents automatically pick up role-specific tasks when idle
  - CFO generates monthly financial reports
  - PR Manager monitors GitHub activity
  - Documentation Manager keeps docs current
  - QA Engineer runs regular test suites
  
  Location: internal/agenticorp/agenticorp.go:2181

  IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE (2026-01-26):

  Created new perpetual task system via motivation framework:
  - internal/motivation/perpetual.go: 15 perpetual task definitions
  - internal/motivation/perpetual_test.go: Comprehensive test suite
  - docs/perpetual-tasks.md: Complete documentation

  Perpetual Tasks Implemented:
  - CFO: Daily budget review, weekly cost optimization (2 tasks)
  - QA Engineer: Daily test runs, weekly integration/regression tests (3 tasks)
  - PR Manager: Hourly GitHub checks, daily community reports (2 tasks)
  - Documentation Manager: Daily audits, weekly consistency checks (2 tasks)
  - DevOps Engineer: Daily infrastructure health, weekly security audits (2 tasks)
  - Project Manager: Daily standup, weekly sprint planning (2 tasks)
  - Housekeeping Bot: Hourly cleanup, weekly archival (2 tasks)

  All tasks use scheduled interval triggers with appropriate cooldown periods.
  Tasks automatically create beads and wake agents on their configured schedules.

  Test Results: All 8 perpetual task tests passing ✓
