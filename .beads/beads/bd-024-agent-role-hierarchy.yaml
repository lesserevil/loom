title: P0 - Define agent role hierarchy (generic JD vs per-project instances)
description: |
  Define a hierarchy for agent roles so that each role has a generic “job
  description” template, and each project can have customized instances of
  those roles.

  Concept
  - Generic role persona = baseline job description (e.g., CEO, CFO, PM, QA).
  - Agent instance = per-project persona that can extend or override the generic
    role instructions without changing the template.

  Requirements
  - Establish a role hierarchy model:
    - role template (generic default persona)
    - role instance (project-specific persona)
  - Allow project-level customization of role instances:
    - start from template
    - modify instructions per agent or project
    - save to project scope only
  - Preserve the default template as immutable (copy-on-write behavior).

  Notes
  - Think of this as job description vs. a specific person hired under that JD.
  - Instances can adapt based on project or agent identity.

  Acceptance Criteria
  - Role hierarchy is defined and documented in the system behavior.
  - Project-specific role instances can be created without mutating templates.
  - System can resolve which persona to use: instance overrides template.
