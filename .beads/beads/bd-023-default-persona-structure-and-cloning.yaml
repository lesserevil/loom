title: P0 - Default personas under personas/default + project agent cloning workflow
description: |
  Update persona structure and agent management to reflect that the shipped
  personas are the default roles used by agents.

  Requirements
  1) Persona directory structure
     - Move default personas from `personas/examples/<role>` to
       `personas/default/<role>` to indicate these are the canonical default
       role templates.

  2) Default agents per project
     - Each tracked project has a group of assigned agents.
     - By default, create all standard agent roles documented in README.md.
     - Each default agent uses the corresponding default persona path.

  3) Persona cloning (copy-on-write)
     - Add an agent clone method (UI + API) that:
       - clones the default persona for a role
       - writes the clone to a new persona path provided by a human
       - assigns the new persona to a cloned agent instance for that project
     - The original default persona must remain unchanged.

  4) Access & control
     - Any user with password access can assign/unassign agents on a project.
     - Any user with password access can trigger persona cloning and edit the
       cloned persona via UI or API.

  Acceptance Criteria
  - Default personas live in `personas/default/<role>`.
  - Projects start with default agents and default personas for each role.
  - Persona cloning creates a new per-project persona without modifying the
    default template.
  - UI/API supports agent assignment and persona cloning.
