title: P1 - Model catalog + model-name parser (size/active params/format/instruct)
description: |
  Implement Arbiter’s recommended model catalog and model-name decoding.

  Scope
  - Add an internal ModelCatalog component that stores:
    - canonical model id/name
    - human label
    - interactivity class (fast/medium/slow)
    - parallelization hints
    - GPU heuristics (min VRAM, suggested GPU class)
    - parsed/derived fields from model name

  Model list (must include)
  - NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-BF16
  - Qwen2.5-Coder models already supported by the system
  - Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct
  - Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct

  Parsing requirements
  - Parse total parameter count from tokens like `480B`, `38B`, `30B`.
  - Parse “active” parameter count from tokens like `A35B`, `A3B`.
  - Parse precision hints like `BF16`, `FP16`, etc.
  - Detect instruct tuning from suffix like `Instruct`.
  - Normalize model family/vendor segments when present (e.g. `Qwen/`).

  Persistence & API
  - Persist catalog in config DB (and include in config export/import).
  - Expose via API for visibility (read-only initially is fine).

  Acceptance Criteria
  - Model catalog exists with required models present.
  - Parser produces derived fields for the required models.
  - Derived fields are available for scoring/selection and (later) UI display.
